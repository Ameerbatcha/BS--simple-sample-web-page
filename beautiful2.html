                        Paris (French pronunciation: is the capital and most populous city of France,
                        with an estimated population of 2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 km² (41
                        sq mi),[4] making it the 34th most densely populated city in the world in 2020.[5] Since the
                        17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce,
                        fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts, and has sometimes been referred to as the capital of the
                        world or "the City of Light".[6] The City of Paris is the centre of the region and province of
                        Île-de-France, or Paris Region, with an estimated population of 12,262,544 in 2019, or about 19%
                        of the population of France.[7] The Paris Region had a GDP of €739 billion ($743 billion) in
                        2019, which is the highest in Europe.[8] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide
                        Cost of Living Survey, in 2021, Paris was the city with the second-highest cost of living in the
                        world, tied with Singapore, and after Tel Aviv.[9]

                        Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports:
                        Paris Charles de Gaulle (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Paris Orly.[10][11] Opened in
                        1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[12] it is
                        the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the
                        24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest located outside Japan, with 262
                        million passengers in 2015.[13] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural
                        landmarks: the Louvre received 2.8 million visitors in 2021, despite the long museum closings
                        caused by the COVID-19 virus.[14] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de
                        l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre
                        Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in
                        Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The
                        historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World
                        Heritage Site since 1991; popular landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris
                        on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other popular
                        tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité;
                        the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and
                        Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the
                        Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and its Basilica of
                        Sacré-Coeur</p>
