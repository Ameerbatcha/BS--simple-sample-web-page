                        Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru
                        on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[2][3] It is located in the Machupicchu District
                        within Urubamba Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of
                        Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon
                        with a tropical mountain climate.[5]

                        For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the name
                        is pronounced

                        The Incas, in contrast to the Maya, had no written language, and no European visited the site
                        until the 19th century, so far as is known. There are, therefore, no written records of the site
                        while it was in use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are
                        all the product of modern archeologists, on the basis of physical evidence, including tombs at
                        the site.

                        Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca
                        emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most
                        familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a
                        century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating,
                        it was occupied from c. 1420–1532.[11] Historical research published in 2022 claims that the
                        site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same
                        name.</p>
